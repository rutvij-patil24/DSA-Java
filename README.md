DSA and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to the DSA and Algorithms in Java repository! This repository contains code examples for fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. The purpose of this repository is to help you understand basic Java concepts and how to apply them to various sorting algorithms, data structures, and threading concepts.

Java Basics
This section covers the fundamental concepts of Java programming:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Explore classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Classes and Interfaces: Learn how to use Java classes, interfaces, and their key features.
Collection APIs: A look into Java's Collection framework, including List, Set, and Map.
Threading in Java: Understand how to manage multiple threads and perform concurrent tasks in Java.

Sorting Algorithms
This section contains popular sorting algorithms implemented in Java:

Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Selection Sort: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm.

Insertion Sort: A simple and intuitive comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Quick Sort: A highly efficient sorting algorithm using the divide-and-conquer technique.

Merge Sort: A stable, efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the array and merges sorted subarrays.

Data Structures
This section covers important data structures and their implementations in Java:

Linked List: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object (node) linked using pointers.

Stack: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure used to store elements in a particular order.

Queue: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure that processes elements in a specific sequence.

Tree: A hierarchical data structure with nodes representing values, linked to each other through parent-child relationships.
